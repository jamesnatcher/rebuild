My new rebuild

In order to run, open file using IDE.

Create two terminals.

Use command "cd practice-app" on both terminals.

Use command "cd frontend" for one terminal and "cd server" for the other.

Use command "ng serve --open" for the fronend terminal, and "nodemon server.ts" for the server terminal.
